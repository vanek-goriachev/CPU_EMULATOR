# every comment should
# be written on its own
# line. otherwise the
# program will not work

# this is a genius
# architectural decision
# provided by the developer
# of this AMAZING LANGUAGE
# (me)

# the idea is that programs
# written in this AMAZING
# LANGUAGE are
# always long vertically
# and short horizontally.
# so adding comments
# on the right
# from the commands
# will break this pattern.
# And this means that
# programmer would not
# have an opportunity to
# have 10 "columns" of code
# opened at once.
# however it is very important
# i decided that language will
# have that restriction

# also comments in russian
# are not supported
# because its better to write
# them in english so our foreign
# friends will be able to
# understand this code

    # btw russian comments just
    # dont work so i created a
    # legend for that above

    # i also didnt use any
    # translators while writing this
    # whole text for
    # a better comedic effect
